This script use the last rsa assignment code, this script create a GUI for the user to log in and use the encryption
and decryption function. The user can either encrypt/decrypt a file or just encrypt/decrypt a message using the text
widgets provided.

The hw6_main.py is the main script for this assignment.

I use splite3 database to store the hashed username and paswords. Normally, this database should be on the server end 
not on the user end but for this assignment the database is on the user end just for simulating the real login procedure.

These are the two usernames and passwords:
hherbol1 Fifa
SherryLiu   fox
